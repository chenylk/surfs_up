# surfs_up
## Overview
 * This project analyzed weather and precipiation data from several stations in Oahu. The information obtained was used to determine whether a surf shop and ice cream shop are viable businesses year round. 

## Results
 * The average temperature was 74.944 and 71.042 for June and December respectively. Both of these conditions would make these businesses sustainable year round. 
 * The December temperature had a higher standard deviation. So with the temperature being more consistent in June, business would be more steady in the summer months. However, even in December it gets as warm as June so there will definitely be busy days. 
 * The minimum temperature in December is almost 10 degrees lower than the minimum temperature in June. There will definitely be days in december where there will be small traffic, but it is still outside 2 standard deviations of the mean so those days will not happen often.

## Summary
  * After looking at the data, the temperature in Oahu seems acceptable to have business thrive year round. The temperature is still warm in the winter which allows for these businesses to stay open. Additional queries that would help the project are the average precipitation for the months of June and December, and the temperature and precipitation for other months in the winter and summer seasons.
